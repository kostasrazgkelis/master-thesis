# Entity Matching Pipeline

> A PySpark-based pipeline for record linkage and entity resolution across multiple datasets

## Project Overview

This thesis project implements a scalable entity matching pipeline designed to identify and link records representing the same real-world entities across multiple datasets. The system addresses the common problem of entity resolution where identical entities appear with variations due to spelling differences, data entry errors, or formatting inconsistencies.

**Research Problem**: How can we automatically identify and group records that represent the same entities across multiple datasets when exact matches are not possible due to data quality issues?

**Solution**: A configurable PySpark pipeline that uses phonetic matching and similarity scoring to create entity clusters with comprehensive evaluation metrics.

## Technical Implementation

The pipeline processes multiple CSV datasets and performs entity matching using the following approach:

```python
from packages.pyspark.entity_matching_pipeline import run_entity_matching
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("EntityMatching").getOrCreate()

# Load datasets
df1 = spark.read.csv("data/df1.csv", header=False).toDF("0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5")
df2 = spark.read.csv("data/df2.csv", header=False).toDF("0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5")
df3 = spark.read.csv("data/df3.csv", header=False).toDF("0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5")

# Execute entity matching
buckets, metrics = run_entity_matching(
    spark=spark,
    left_df=df1,
    right_dataframes=[df2, df3],
    similarity_threshold=0.6,
    min_matching_columns=3
)

# Analyze results
print(f"Total entity groups: {buckets.count()}")
print(f"F1-Score: {metrics['f1_score']:.4f}")
print(f"Precision: {metrics['precision']:.4f}")
print(f"Recall: {metrics['recall']:.4f}")
```

## Problem Domain and Motivation

Entity resolution is a fundamental challenge in data integration and master data management. Common scenarios include:

- **Customer Data Integration**: Merging customer records from different business systems
- **Academic Research**: Linking publications and authors across bibliographic databases
- **Healthcare**: Patient record matching across hospital systems
- **E-commerce**: Product catalog deduplication and matching
- **Compliance**: Entity matching against watchlists and regulatory databases

### Challenges Addressed

1. **Spelling Variations**: "Smith" vs "Smyth", "McDonald" vs "MacDonald"
2. **Data Entry Errors**: Typos and transcription mistakes
3. **Formatting Differences**: "123 Main St" vs "123 Main Street"
4. **Incomplete Information**: Missing or partial field values
5. **Scalability**: Processing large datasets with millions of records

## System Architecture

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Origin Tracking**: Each dataset receives a unique identifier to maintain data lineage
- **Phonetic Normalization**: Soundex transformation converts text to phonetic codes (e.g., "Smith" and "Smyth" both become "S530")
- **Schema Standardization**: Ensures consistent column naming and data types

### 2. Entity Key Generation
- **Composite Key Creation**: Concatenates matching columns to create entity signatures
- **Cross-Dataset Preparation**: Structures data for efficient comparison operations

### 3. Similarity Calculation
- **Cross-Join Processing**: Compares all records from left dataset against right datasets
- **Column-wise Matching**: Calculates similarity based on matching attribute columns
- **Scoring Algorithm**: Generates similarity scores as ratio of matching columns to total columns

### 4. Threshold Filtering and Bucket Assignment
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Filters record pairs based on similarity scores and minimum matching columns
- **Max Similarity Strategy**: Assigns entities to buckets with highest similarity scores
- **Alternative Threshold Strategy**: Accepts all pairs above specified similarity threshold

### 5. Evaluation and Metrics
- **Ground Truth Calculation**: Determines actual matching pairs for evaluation
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates precision, recall, F1-score, and bucket statistics
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Provides detailed analysis of matching quality

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

**MultiPartyRecordLinkage Class**: Main pipeline implementation with configurable matching parameters

**MatchingConfig**: Configuration dataclass supporting:
- Similarity thresholds (0.0 - 1.0)
- Minimum matching column requirements
- Phonetic transformation options
- Bucket assignment strategies

**Helper Functions**: Simplified API for common use cases and multi-dataset scenarios

### Algorithm Characteristics

- **Time Complexity**: O(n×m) where n is left dataset size and m is combined right dataset size
- **Space Complexity**: Optimized through Spark's distributed processing and caching strategies
- **Scalability**: Tested on datasets ranging from hundreds to millions of records

7. **Vortex PySpark Pipeline Proposal**
    ![Data Architecture](docs/pipelines/hashed_vortex_proposal_architecture.png)
    There is another variation of the multiparty record linkage (MRL) solution where we build a vortex that will store the total data in an indexed structure. This should
    reduce complexity of the system, caching the MRL hashed data and be used later when requested by any party.

```python
buckets, metrics = run_entity_matching(
    spark=spark, left_df=df1, right_dataframes=[df2],
    similarity_threshold=0.4,  # 40% similarity required
    min_matching_columns=2     # 2 out of 5 columns must match
)
